## MSc Thesis, Wavelets applied, 2006

Preface

This paper is the result of a master thesis work in applied mathematics at GÃ¶teborg University. From the beginning, the purpose was to find a way to detect the presence of speech in an audio signal with the use of wavelets. During the investigation it turned out that this was a field where some features of the wavelet transform could be used, but the gain of expanding the audio directly into wavelets was not obvious. Focus was therefore shifted to other areas where wavelets could be useful, e.g. to the solution of differential equations. It was also investigated how wavelets could be used to invert the Radon transform, associated to medical imaging. This paper should therefore, in essence, be considered as a discussion about applications of wavelets.
